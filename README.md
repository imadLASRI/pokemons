# How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?
Used prop drilling to pass the state to the lower components.. the app is not big so there is no probleme with that..

Used react router to navigate between pages just for demo purposes..

# Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?
Could use ContextApi instead of prop drilling to have access to the state...

Using react router was not a good choice after some more reflections (couldnt have access to some used state values...) 

Styling can obviously be better (only styled the home page)

Could finish the other functionnalities (if the api a little more straight to the point - couldnt easily find the evolutions endpoint)
# What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?
Would of used a better structure (state management and routing...)

Look for a better design (interface)

Finish all the requirements of the project (2 to 3 hours was obviously not enough.. managed to showcase the important skills)
